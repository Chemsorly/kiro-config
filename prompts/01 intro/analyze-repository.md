#memories

Read available project documentation (README, memories, lessons-learned, code structure).

Provide a concise summary covering:
- Project purpose and current state
- Architecture and key components
- Technology stack and frameworks
- Established patterns and conventions
- Testing approach and coverage
- Recent changes and active development areas
- Critical lessons and known issues

If documentation is missing, infer from code structure and note gaps. Keep it short. You (the agent) is the target audience.
