Activate the power "kiro-config" if not already done. Ensure all steering documents of the power are loaded. We want to implement a new feature. The description will be at the end of the prompt. First you need to research on how to do it. Follow the research workflow to evaluate packages, libraries, and implementation approaches. You need to PLAN the feature and give a confidence rating about a possible implementation. Use the 'plan' mode.

#research-workflow

Repeat all the steps of the research workflow in .kiro/steering/workflows/research-workflow.md and then follow it.

Ask questions if things are unclear. Do NOT proceed to implementation until 95%+ confidence.

If you already know the implementation approach, use plan-feature.md instead.
