Activate power "kiro-config" if needed. Verify steering files are loaded (check steeringFiles array in activation response). If not loaded, use action="readSteering". DO NOT create steering files - they already exist in the power.

We want to implement a new feature. The description will be at the end of the prompt. First you need to research on how to do it. Follow the research workflow to evaluate packages, libraries, and implementation approaches. You need to PLAN the feature and give a confidence rating about a possible implementation. Use the 'plan' mode.

#workflows-research-workflow

Follow the research workflow to evaluate packages, libraries, and implementation approaches.

Ask questions if things are unclear. Do NOT proceed to implementation until 95%+ confidence.

If you already know the implementation approach, use plan-feature.md instead.
