Activate the power "kiro-config" if not already done. Ensure all steering documents of the power are loaded. We want to implement a new feature. The description will be at the end of the prompt.

Repeat every step of the plan workflow in .kiro/steering/core/project-system.md and then follow it, running in plan mode.

This prompt is for features with KNOWN implementation approaches. If you need to research use research-feature.md instead.
