# Research Workflow
## Purpose
Defines the sequence for researching packages, libraries, and implementation approaches.

## Instructions
- Step 1: Use Context7 for official documentation and code examples (ID: RESEARCH_CONTEXT7_FIRST)
- Step 2: If Context7 insufficient, use web-search for alternatives and comparisons (ID: RESEARCH_WEB_FALLBACK)
- Step 3: Evaluate confidence using language-specific criteria (ID: RESEARCH_CONFIDENCE_CHECK)
- Step 4: Document findings and proceed to implementation workflow (ID: RESEARCH_DOCUMENT)

## Workflow Chain
Context7 → Web-search (if needed) → Confidence evaluation → Implementation workflow

## Iterative Development Support
- Allow returning to research phase during implementation if new requirements emerge (ID: RESEARCH_ITERATIVE_RETURN)
- Support context switching between multiple research topics (ID: RESEARCH_CONTEXT_SWITCHING)
- Enable partial research completion with documented gaps (ID: RESEARCH_PARTIAL_COMPLETION)

## Priority
Medium

## Error Handling
- If research incomplete, document gaps and proceed with available information
- Update confidence levels based on research quality
